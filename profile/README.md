## Astronomical software written in Typescript

This organisation has the ambition of being the equivalent of [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org) for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Whilst it is unlikely to 
achieve the huge sucess of Astropy, partly at least because the audience for these libraries will necessarily be limited to developers rather than "scripting users" that Python attracts, it does start from the same basis of having a TypeScript native implementation of the [SOFA library](http://www.iausofa.org).
